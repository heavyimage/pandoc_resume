Professional Experience
-----------------------

2020
:	**Application Vulnerability Testing** Robot Talk (New York)

Lead local application tests for a multi-platform Electron / Go based application. Used discreet proxy and fuzzing tools to inspect traffic and API endpoints. Compiled vulnerability report as part of overall client security remediation audit.

2019-present
:	**Pipeline Consultant**, (Global)

Leveraging my 10 years of Visual Effects (VFX) industry experience I now consult for various studios to assist them with their pipeline / technical needs.

2014-2019
:	**Senior Pipeline Technical Director**, Framestore (New York, London)

After working as a VFX artist I made the transition to 2D/Pipeline Technical Director (TD), which I did for 5 years.

I was hired by Framestore for my programming skills and experience as a compositor to be the point person for the 2D aspects of their new Integrated Advertising pipeline.

Key accomplishments:

* Personally co-designed and implemented many of our core 2d workflows -- ingest publishing, lockdown, interactive publish visualization badges, prerender bypass, editorial ingest and conform, review and export to client
* Helped integrate shotgun / SGTK into the studio and educate artists / leads about these tools. Working closely with artists integrated / modified (via hooks or forking) many SGTK apps to better fit our usage patterns, passing code / comments back to Shotgun
* Massively modified the tk-hiero-export app to support timeline exports, published audio and modular updates of SG Shot fields
* Developed user-friendly renderfarm, asset library, and client download area integration (developed by other teams at FS) for Nuke and Hiero
* Managed code releases for multiple libraries across dozens of projects and multiple versions of Nuke / Hiero simultaneously
* Wrote GUI (PyQt / PySide) and command line tools to interact with the pipeline
* Wrote extra actions for Loader and Workfiles Manager to simply common artist tasks. Also helped bridge this actions directly into Nuke via shim
* Wrote a few show-specfic Nuke tools e.g. a screenspace rigging tool
* Helped integrate OCIO/ACES into our environment and updating our tools to be driven by OCIO where appropriate
* Developed tools to leverage the 'metadata web' of published files that are built during production into tools eg: 'load all geo used in this render' or 'import Nuke script that made this render'
* Helped comp on a tricky section of the Spectre (James Bond) title sequence
* Debugged complex Nuke / Hiero scripts from production, often with gdb
* Managed and defended the codebase, insisting on global collaboration and relevance before making changes; Saying 'no'
* Co-winner of Shotgun 'Shotty' Award for my team's work with SGTK

2009-2014
:	**Freelance and Staff Compositor**, (New York and London)

I worked for 6 years as a Compositor (VFX artist) across multiple films, TV shows and advertisement campaigns, including the Oscar nominated film "Inside Llewyn Davis" and the James Bond Film "Spectre".

I performed start-to-finish compositing (paint and roto, 2d and 3d tracking, keying, color correction and full comp work) for at least 30 TV and Film projects in Shake and Nuke.

My IMDB profile is [here](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2993340/) and my 2013 showreel is [here](https://vimeo.com/63213779).
